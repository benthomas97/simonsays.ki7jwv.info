This is the README file for my Vue clone of "Simon".

"Simon" is a memory game in which the user must memorize a pattern generated by a computer and repeat the pattern back to the computer. If the user repeats the pattern correctly, the pattern becomes one unit longer. This continues until the user messes up the pattern.
